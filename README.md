# CUDA Triangular Domain Problems

This repository contains implementations and experiments focused on solving triangular domain problems using CUDA for GPU-accelerated computation. The project demonstrates how triangular domains can be managed more efficiently compared to traditional square or rectangular grid methods.

## Features

- CUDA-accelerated solvers for triangular domain problems.
- Efficient memory handling for non-square domains.
- Parallel computing examples and benchmarks.
- Implementations using CUDA and C for high-performance computation.
